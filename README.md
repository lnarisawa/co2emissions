# Total CO2 Emissions Background Information
co2emissions project for MATH 2315. This project is for learning basic programming and visualization of dense data sets by utilizing the csv data provided by OWID for the top ten emitters. The data analysis focuses on total emissions over time for the top ten emitters of 2020 over the period 1971-2020.
## Software
The data analysis was completed on colab by Google, and requires the libraries of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, & seaborn.
## Data
The data is formatted in a CSV file and is separated by country and alphabetized. Various data by year is included for each country, such as gain or per capita emissions. The data was retrieved 3_28_2023 and the latest version can be retrieved at https://github.com/owid/co2-data
## Data Processing
The data was cleaned by the removal of any non-countries, which may include aggregates of countries by region or data for the entire world, which would result in incorrect averaging. The data was also intentionally analyzed over the time period listed above to avoid missing data points from earlier time periods.
